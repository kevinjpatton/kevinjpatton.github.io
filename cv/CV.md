Independent Studies

1. PHIL3960 Kant: Ethics and Values, Spring 2024

   Taught an independent study on Kant’s ethical and axiological commitments. This independent study required meeting with the student twice a week to discuss assigned readings, and to review any written work. Ultimately, this resulted in the student authoring three papers. The first two were shorter and narrowly focused responses to specific issues at play for a Kantian. The second of these two papers was developed into a longer paper which sought to argue that Christine Korsgaard’s Kantian ethics could, with certain modifications, overcome a specific objection. This paper is intended to also serve as the foundation for a writing seminar paper (a course required for the philosophy major) for the student.

   Honors Contracts

1. PHIL2030 Introduction to Ethics, Fall 2023

   Supervised an honors contract for a student which focused on a detailed reading of G.E. Moore’s *Principia Ethica* in order to assess Moore’s intuitionism. This culminated in weekly reading summaries for relevant chapters and sections of the *Principia*, and ultimately into a research paper where the student concluded that Moore’s intuitionism was internally inconsistent. This paper is intended to also serve as the foundation for a writing seminar paper (a course required for the philosophy major) for the student. 

2. PHIL2300 Human Values in Medicine, Fall 2022

   Supervised an honors contract which focused on issues related to reducing cases of SIDS across culturally diverse societies. This culminated in an in class student-led lecture that described the current state of research on the issue, and possible avenues of future research. This project tied in with the student's larger research project in preparation for medical school applications.

3. PHIL2300 Human Values in Medicine, Fall 2022

   Supervised an honors contract which focused on the lack of accessibility for, and economic impact of, IVF on patients. This culminated in the student lecturing for a class on the topic. This project tied in with the student’s larger research focus on the biological and ethical aspects of medical care in preparation for the student’s medical school application.

Dissertation

Title:		The Value of Knowledge and its Problems

Committee:	David Henderson (committee chair)

			William Melanson (reader)

			Aaron Bronfman (reader)

			Edward Becker (reader)

This dissertation answers the three value problems in epistemology. These three problems require an answer as to how knowledge is more valuable 1\) than mere true belief, 2\) any of the proper subsets of knowledge, and 3\) in kind than that which falls short of knowledge. The methodology used to provide an answer to these problems relies on the arguments put forth in a rarely discussed paper from Ward Jones. In short, the Jonesian approach can be summed up as the view that epistemic axiology and analysis ought to be kept separate. The Jonesian framework instead looks outside of the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge to find properties of knowledge which, though contingent, can explain the distinctive value of knowledge. This framework, though remarkably robust, requires going against what I consider to be the orthodox approach to the problems. This orthodox approach relies on two axiological assumptions. The first is that every component of an analysis on knowledge must provide independent value to knowledge. The second assumption is that the value of knowledge cannot be derived from factors excluded from an analysis of knowledge. Once these assumptions are appropriately discarded, the Jonesian view has a straightforward answer to the first problem. Answering the second requires assessing Jonathan Kvanvig’s claim that a satisfied Gettier condition contributes no independent value. While I agree with Kvanvig regarding a satisfied Gettier condition, I will argue that an unsatisfied Gettier condition is not likewise neutral; it contributes disvalue. With that distinction in place, a solution to the second problem follows immediately. The third value problem, however, is a different kind of problem altogether. Answering it requires not only the Jonesian framework, but also a novel account of how we determine final value. Once this account is offered, a Jonesian answer to the tertiary problem follows immediately. This dissertation closes by applying the Jonesian framework to an argument that claims there can be no modal conditions on knowledge due to such conditions failing to help answer the value problems. This claim will be found wanting.
