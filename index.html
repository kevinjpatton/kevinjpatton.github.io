	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>I am a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>.  My research interests include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Logic, the Philosophy of Language, Science, Mind, and Religion.  My dissertation focuses on what are known as the value problem in epistemology.  I am nearing completion of the dissertation and will (hopefully!) be defending either this spring or summer.  I am currently a full-time visiting professor for the <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/philosophy/about-us/directory/kevin-patton.php" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Omaha</a> (my alma mater).  If you are a student of mine, then the Teaching tab at the top is likely what you are here to access.  Select the class that you are taking from me to find the relevant course material.</p>
	<p>I wouldn't have been able to build this site in only a few days on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> if it wasn't for great explanations by <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone" target="_blank">Jonathan McGlone</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>.   Good teachers and good tools are invaluable!</p>
