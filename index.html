	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>As a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>, I'm fascinated by questions of knowledge, reality, logic, language, science, the mind, and religion.  My current research delves into the complexities of value in epistemology.  While working on my dissertation, I have the privilege of teaching full-time as a visiting professor at my alma mater, the <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/philosophy/about-us/directory/kevin-patton.php" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Omaha</a>. If you're one of my students, you'll find course materials and updates under the Teaching tab.</p>
