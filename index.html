            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Welcome, students and philosophers alike! My time as a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is coming to a close as I will be defending my dissertation this summer (2024). The dissertation explores the orthodox approach to the value of knowledge and its associated problems. This orthodox approach is ultimately rejected, and a novel series of answers are offered to those long-standing problems. Additionally I'm very fortunate to be a visiting professor at my alma mater, the University of Nebraska - Omaha. If you're a current student of mine, you can access the course resources under the Teaching tab. Once my dissertation is successfully defended, it will be accessible via ProQuest, and uploaded here under the Research tab. If you wish to contact me, then please use the Contact tab  above.<br><br>
When I'm not teaching, I tend to focus on one of my hobbies. I love tackling home improvement projects, especially those that get me outside in the spring and fall. My wife and I love exploring new culinary and travel destinations. Additionally, we have two pups (seen in the picture above) who love to explore with us. I can also be found attempting to lift weights (though a series of herniatic discs has sadly put an end to my powerlifting aspirations).  I'm also an avid gamer, with a particular fondness for The Last of Us Part 2. Currently, I'm obsessed with Helldivers 2 on Playstation, though I'm eagerly awaiting the day when graphics cards become more affordable so I can dive back into PC gaming.</p>
