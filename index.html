	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>Welcome, students and philosophers alike! My time as a graduate student at the  <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a> is coming to a close as I will be defending my dissertation this summer (2024). The dissertation explores the orthodox approach to the value of knowledge and its associated problems. This orthodox approach is ultimately rejected, and a novel series of answers are offered to those long-standing problems. Additionally I'm very fortunate to be a visiting professor at my alma mater, the <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/philosophy/about-us/directory/kevin-patton.php" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Omaha</a>. If you're a current student of mine, you can access the course resources under the Teaching tab. Once my dissertation is successfully defended, it will be accessible via ProQuest, and uploaded here under the Research tab. If you wish to contact me, then please use the Contact tab above.</p>
