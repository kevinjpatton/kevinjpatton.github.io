	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>I am a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>.  I am currently in my sixth year of the program.  My research interests include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Logic, the Philosophy of Language, Science, Mind, and Religion.  My dissertation is focusing on the issues surrounding Duncan Pritchard's claims about epistemic luck, and how his notion of safety can address the value problem in epistemology.</p>
	<p>I received my BA in philosophy from the University of Nebraska-Omaha.  My hobbies include enjoy powerlifting, anything computer related, and the remodeling and repairing of my home.  I am heavily indebted to the opensource community as I wouldn't have been able to build this site in only a few days on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> if it wasn't for great explanations by <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone" target="_blank">Jonathan McGlone</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>.  Good teachers are invaluable!</p>
