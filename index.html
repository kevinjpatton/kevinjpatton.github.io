	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>I am a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>.  My research interests include Metaphysics, Epistemology, Logic, the Philosophy of Language, Science, Mind, and Religion.  My dissertation focuses on what are known as the value problem in epistemology.  I am nearing completion of the dissertation and will (hopefully!) be defending either this spring or summer.  I am currently a full-time visiting instructor for the <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/philosophy/about-us/directory/kevin-patton.php" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Omaha (my alma mater)</a>.</p>
	<p>My hobbies include powerlifting, anything computer related, gaming, and the remodeling and repairing of my home.  I am heavily indebted to the opensource community as I wouldn't have been able to build this site in only a few days on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> if it wasn't for great explanations by <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone" target="_blank">Jonathan McGlone</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>.  Good teachers are invaluable!</p>
	<p>If you are a student of mine, then the Teaching tab at the top is likely what you are here to access.  Select the class that you are taking from me to find the relevant course material.</p>
