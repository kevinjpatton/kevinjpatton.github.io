            <p><b>Welcome, students and philosophers alike!</b> My name is Kevin Patton and I am aninstructor of philosophy at  the University of Nebraska - Omaha (also my alma mater). If you're a current student of mine, then you can access materials related to our class by selecting Teaching from the menu. I teach a broad range of courses, from introductory ethics and the meaning of life, to the philosophy of video games, ethical theory, and metaphysics. Additionally, I also teach a summer course that is offered to both undergraduate and graduate students at UNO. My dissertation, which focused on the value problems in epistemology, was successfully defended last summer. I am also fascinated by issues at the intersection of AI, ethics, and conciousness. In addition to preparing select chapters of the dissertation for publication, I recently published a paper addressing ethical considerations surrounding AI-related legislation.</p>
