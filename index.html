            <p><b>Welcome, students and philosophers alike!</b> I am happy to report that I am a recently minted PhD, having just received my degree on August 2nd from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My dissertation explores the orthodox approach to the value of knowledge and its associated problems. You can find out more about that by selecting Dissertation from the menu above.<br><br>I'm also very fortunate to be an instructor at my alma mater, the University of Nebraska - Omaha. If you're a current student of mine, then you can access resources related to our class by selecting Teaching from the menu. I teach a broad range of courses, from introductory ethics and the meaning of life, to the philosophy of video games, ethical theory, and metaphysics. Additionally, I also teach a summer course that is offered to both undergraduate and graduate students at UNO. </p>
