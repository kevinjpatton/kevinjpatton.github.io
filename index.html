            <p><b>Welcome, students and philosophers alike!</b> I am happy to report that I am a recently minted PhD, having just received my degree on August 2nd from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My dissertation explores the orthodox approach to the value of knowledge and its associated problems. This orthodox approach is ultimately rejected, and a novel series of answers are offered to those long-standing problems. You can find out more about that by selecting "Dissertation" from the menu.<br><br>I'm also very fortunate to be a visiting professor at my alma mater, the University of Nebraska - Omaha. If you're a current student of mine, then you can access resources related to our class by selecting "Teaching" from the menu. If you wish to contact me, then please select "Contact" from the menu.<br><br>When I'm not teaching, I tend to focus on one of my hobbies. I love tackling home improvement projects, especially those that get me outside during the spring and fall. Additionally, my wife and I love exploring new culinary and travel destinations (we just recently returned from Italy!). Additionally, we have two pups (seen in the picture above) who love to explore with us. I can also be found attempting to lift weights (though a series of herniated discs has sadly put an end to my powerlifting aspirations). I'm also an avid gamer, with a particular fondness for The Last of Us Part 2. Currently, I'm obsessed with Helldivers 2 on Playstation, though I'm eagerly awaiting the day when graphics cards become more affordable so I can dive back into PC gaming. I have recently added a section on pedagogy to this website, so if you are interested in seeing how I approach the teaching of philosophy, please select "Pedagogy" from the menu. My CV is also available under "CV".</p>
