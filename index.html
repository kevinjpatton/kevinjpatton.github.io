	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>Welcome, students and philosophers alike! My time as a graduate student at the  <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a> is coming to a close as I will be defending my dissertation this summer (2024). The dissertation explores the orthodox approach to the value of knowledge and its associated problems. This orthodox approach is ultimately rejected, and a novel series of answers are offered to those long-standing problems. Additionally I'm very fortunate to be a visiting professor at my alma mater, the <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/philosophy/about-us/directory/kevin-patton.php" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Omaha</a>. If you're a current student of mine, you can access the course resources under the <a href="/teaching/index.html" ><b>Teaching</b></a> tab. Once my dissertation is successfully defended, it will be accessible via ProQuest, and uploaded here under the <a href="/teaching/index.html"><b>Research</b></a> tab tab. If you wish to contact me, then please use the <a href="/teaching/index.html"><b>Contact</b></a> tab tab above.<br>
When I'm not teaching, I can be found attempting to lift weights (though a herniatic disc has sadly put an end to my powerlifting aspirations). I also love tackling home improvement projects, especially those that get me outside in the spring and fall. My wife and I love exploring new culinary and travel destinations. Additionally, we have two pups (seen in the picture above) who love to explore with us.  In my downtime, I'm an avid gamer, with a particular fondness for The Last of Us Part 2. Currently, I'm obsessed with Helldivers 2 on Playstation, though I'm eagerly awaiting the day when graphics cards become more affordable so I can dive back into PC gaming.</p>
