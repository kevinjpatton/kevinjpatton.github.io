            <p><b>Welcome, students and philosophers alike!</b> I have successfully defended my dissertation and will be receiving my PhD from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on August 2nd, 2024! The dissertation explores the orthodox approach to the value of knowledge and its associated problems. This orthodox approach is ultimately rejected, and a novel series of answers are offered to those long-standing problems.<br><br>I'm also very fortunate to be a visiting professor at my alma mater, the University of Nebraska - Omaha. If you're a current student of mine, you can access the course resources under the Teaching tab. The dissertation is currently undergoing a final bit of editing. Once complete, it will be accessible via ProQuest and CreativeCommons in the fall and uploaded here under the Research tab.<br><br>If you wish to contact me, then please use the Contact tab above.<br><br>When I'm not teaching, I tend to focus on one of my hobbies. I love tackling home improvement projects, especially those that get me outside in the spring and fall. My wife and I love exploring new culinary and travel destinations. Additionally, we have two pups (seen in the picture above) who love to explore with us. I can also be found attempting to lift weights (though a series of herniatic discs has sadly put an end to my powerlifting aspirations). I'm also an avid gamer, with a particular fondness for The Last of Us Part 2. Currently, I'm obsessed with Helldivers 2 on Playstation, though I'm eagerly awaiting the day when graphics cards become more affordable so I can dive back into PC gaming.</p>
