For our first class of the semester we discussed course expectations and requirements, as well as how to access course materials.  For Thursday's class, please read the following PDF on Moral Reasoning.  You can download the PDF <a href="/teaching/phil_365/MoralReasoning.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please pay special attention to the end of reading beginning with the section <b>Moral Arguments</b>.  Happy reading!</p>
<p><b>January 23</b><br>
For our second class we began discussing many of the basic concepts needed to properly engage ethics.  I (finally) have finished the handout for this class and you can download it <a href="/teaching/phil_365/Handout - Basic Concepts.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  For Tuesday, please do the reading assigned in the syllabus.  Happy reading!</p>
<p><b>January 28</b><br>
For class today we examined Betham's hedonistic core, and how that played out in terms of determining right and wrong moral action.  We did not get to Mill today, so we will cover that Thursday and push Kant back one class period.  That means no new reading for Thursday!  The handout for the Bentham lecture can be downloaded <a href="https://kevinjpatton.github.io/teaching/phil_2030/Handout_Pleasure.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  See ya Thursday!</p>
