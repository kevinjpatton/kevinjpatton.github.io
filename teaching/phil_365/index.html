For our first class of the semester we discussed course expectations and requirements, as well as how to access course materials.  For Thursday's class, please read the following PDF on Moral Reasoning.  You can download the PDF <a href="/teaching/phil_365/MoralReasoning.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please pay special attention to the end of reading beginning with the section <b>Moral Arguments</b>.  Happy reading!</p>
<p><b>January 23</b><br>
For our second class we began discussing many of the basic concepts needed to properly engage ethics.  I (finally) have finished the handout for this class and you can download it <a href="/teaching/phil_365/Handout - Basic Concepts.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  For Tuesday, please do the reading assigned in the syllabus.  Happy reading!</p>
<p><b>January 28</b><br>
For class today we examined Bentham's hedonistic core, and how that played out in terms of determining right and wrong moral action.  We did not get to Mill today, so we will cover that Thursday and push Kant back one class period.  That means no new reading for Thursday!  The handout for the Bentham lecture can be downloaded <a href="https://kevinjpatton.github.io/teaching/phil_2030/Handout_Pleasure.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  See ya Thursday!</p>
<p><b>January 30</b><br>
For class today we examined Mill's modifications to Bentham's system and how that provided principled ways for Mill to avoid many of the objections that we raised to Bentham's theory.  The handout for the Mill lecture can be downloaded <a href="https://kevinjpatton.github.io/teaching/phil_2030/Handout_Mill.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  For Tuesday, we will be discussing Kant's theory about morality, so read that chapter from the textbook.  See ya Tuesday!</p>
<p><b>February 6</b><br>
For class today we examined Virtue Theory, and discussed some potential objections to the theory.  The handout for virtue theory can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_2030/Handout_Virtue.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  For Tuesday, please read the following PDF available for download <a href="/teaching/phil_365/4PrincPlusScope.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Also, the reading quizzes should be live on Canvas now so take them when you have time over the next two weeks.  Happy reading and see you Tuesday!</p>
<p><b>February 13</b><br>
For class today we went through the Four Principles + Scope paper, and did our best to understand both their theory neutral nature, and how best to understand each principle.  There is no reading for next week as we will be having a review day on Tuesday, and then the first exam on Thursday.  It is true that we are a bit ahead of schedule on the syllabus.  That is because we are going to put off the case studies until after the first exam.  I began to worry that the exam would be longer than our class period if we included more material, so let's hope I'm right!  You can download the study guide for the exam <a href="/teaching/phil_365/Handout - Exam 1 Review.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please come to class Tuesday with any / all the questions that you have!  Happy studying!</p>
<p><b>February 27</b><br>
For class we went through the case study on the <i>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</i> case.  You all requested a bit more philosophy before we dive all the way into case study analysis, so we are going to look at a philosopher who denies that there are any moral truths.  His name is J.L. Mackie and you can download the relevant chapter <a href="/teaching/phil1020/Mackie.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  You can download the handout on his view <a href="/teaching/phil_2030/Handout_ErrorTheory.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  This reading may be a bit difficult, so work through it slowly and try to have read the first half by Tuesday, which is also when you will be getting your exams back.  Happy reading!</p>
