<p><b>January 28</b><br>
For class today we examined Bentham's hedonistic core, and how that played out in terms of determining right and wrong moral action.  We did not get to Mill today, so we will cover that Thursday and push Kant back one class period.  That means no new reading for Thursday!  The handout for the Bentham lecture can be downloaded <a href="https://kevinjpatton.github.io/teaching/phil_2030/Handout_Pleasure.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  See ya Thursday!</p>
<p><b>January 30</b><br>
For class today we examined Mill's modifications to Bentham's system and how that provided principled ways for Mill to avoid many of the objections that we raised to Bentham's theory.  The handout for the Mill lecture can be downloaded <a href="https://kevinjpatton.github.io/teaching/phil_2030/Handout_Mill.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  For Tuesday, we will be discussing Kant's theory about morality, so read that chapter from the textbook.  See ya Tuesday!</p>
<p><b>February 6</b><br>
For class today we examined Virtue Theory, and discussed some potential objections to the theory.  The handout for virtue theory can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_2030/Handout_Virtue.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  For Tuesday, please read the following PDF available for download <a href="/teaching/phil_365/4PrincPlusScope.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Also, the reading quizzes should be live on Canvas now so take them when you have time over the next two weeks.  Happy reading and see you Tuesday!</p>
