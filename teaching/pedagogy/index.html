<h2>Introductory / General Education Classes</h2>
<p><b>Structure:</b> My introductory / general education philosophy courses aim to provide a broad foundation and foster a love of critical inquiry. Classes typically begin with readings from secondary sources which masterfully introduce a key philosophical theory. Subsequent sessions delve deeper into a challenging area of the theory, often focusing on a very specific issue (e.g. Kant versus Korsgaard on lying). Generative AI tools are integrated to create complex scenarios, challenging students to apply these theories in a practical context.<br><b>Assessment:</b> Assessments in introductory classes are designed to support students' development. Exams initially mirror the kind of standard assessment style of American public high-school (i.e. multiple choice and short answer prompts) to complex philosophical analysis (i.e. the applications of theories to cases, exposition of the views of various authors, and attempts at original argument). Annotated notes ensure consistent engagement and offer a way for students to demonstrate their understanding. The final assessment incorporates AI-generated even more complex ethical scenarios, mirroring the in-class focus on applying philosophy to real-world problems.</p>

<h2>Specialized / Upper-level Classes</h2>
<p><b>Structure:</b> In specialized / upper-level courses, depth replaces breadth as the primary focus. The specific topic and direction of exploration vary based on the course and student interests. However, across all such classes, I encourage students to take the lead in driving discussions and formulating their own philosophical positions. Classes usually center around in-depth readings and seminar-style conversations.<br><b>Assessment:</b> To promote deeper engagement and develop writing skills, students in specialized courses submit both annotated notes over one of the weekâ€™s readings, and their own version of an abstract for the other reading. Traditional papers are often supplemented with alternative assessments emphasizing critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and philosophical analysis. A heavy emphasis on the creation of visual representations of philosophical concepts or arguments is included so as to help create alternative ways of explanation. This can take the form of flow charts, diagrams, or even comic strips (in the style of <a href="existentialcomics.com" target="_blank">Existential Comics</a>).</p>
