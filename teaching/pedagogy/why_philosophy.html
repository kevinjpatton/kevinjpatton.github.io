<h2>Learning Philosophy</h2>
<p>I view the philosophy classroom as a space for curiosity, critical analysis, and transformative discovery. My approach centers on guiding students towards uncovering the intuitive motivations behind different philosophical views and thoughtfully exploring the implications of those intuitions. Through this process, students develop the tools to examine their own beliefs, engage in meaningful dialogue, and contribute reasoned perspectives to the world around them.  The analytical rigor fostered within philosophy equips students to excel in a wide range of fields and provides them with the intellectual foundations for meaningful, engaged lives.</p>
<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<p>My approach to introductory philosophy courses centers on revealing the intuitive motivations behind different views and exploring the potential consequences of those intuitions. In my ethics course, for example, I help students uncover their own moral intuitions, facilitating a deeper understanding of and engagement with complex theories. This emphasis on the intuitive, combined with a rigorous investigation into the truth-makers of ethical claims, forms a powerful combination that draws students into the discipline and inspires them to become active participants in the philosophical process.
In upper-level courses, while still highlighting motivations and implications, I shift the focus towards diving deeply into the classic and contemporary literature relevant to that field. The goal is for students to achieve competency in the respective philosophical discourse. For example, my "Philosophy of Video Games" course leans more into the aesthetics literature, whereas my Ethical Theory course often focuses on either the reasons literature or axiology.</p>
<h2>Double Majoring in Philosophy</h2>
<p>A double major in philosophy offers a powerful combination of intellectual growth and practical advantage. Philosophy's emphasis on critical thinking, argument analysis, and effective communication cultivates highly transferable skills sought after in diverse fields.  Studies consistently show that philosophy majors outperform those in many other disciplines on standardized tests essential for graduate school or professional programs. Beyond intellectual enrichment, philosophy graduates demonstrate strong earning potential across various careers, often surpassing those who specialize in seemingly more "practical" fields. Double majoring in philosophy equips students with the intellectual rigor and adaptability to navigate a rapidly evolving world, opening doors to both personal fulfillment and long-term success.</p>
