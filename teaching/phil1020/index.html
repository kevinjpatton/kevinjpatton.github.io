<h1>Fall 2018</h1>
<p>The course syllabus can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil1020/Phil1020Syllabus_v_1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Aug 22</h1>
<p>Please read sections 1.1 and 1.2 from the following logic text book.  You can download it <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Phil110_Textbook.pdf.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  I have also created a handout for these sections which you can download <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day2-Section1.1-1.2.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!</p> 
<h1>Aug 24</h1>
<p>Today we finished our breif introduction to logic by discussing valid and invalid arguments, as well cogent and non-cogent.  We also discussed some common fallacies to be aware of, and why there are harmful to reasoning.  You can download a handout on some common fallacies <a href=/teaching/phil1020/PBS_Fallacies.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  For Monday, please read the following sections from John Stewart Mill's famous work, <i>Utlitarianism</i>: 1) Happiness as an Aim (starts on page 7); 2) Chapter 3.  We will discuss the implications of this moral philosophy, and I encourage you all to work on your argument extractions for this text.  Remember to answer the following quesitons: 1) What are the author's premises?  2) What is the author's conclusion?  The link for the reading is <a href=https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/mill1863.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!</p> 
<h1>Aug 27</h1>
<p>Today we began discussing Mill's version of Consequentialism.  For Wednesday, there is NO reading (woo) but please watch <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/ap-perfect-competition-topic/ap-nash-eq-tutorial/v/prisoners-dilemma-and-nash-equilibrium target="_blank">this Khan Academy video on the prisons' dilemma</a>.  As you watch this video, ask yourself how someone who listened to their conscience ALONE in determining what to do would do.  Does this seem rational from an objective standpoint?  We will discuss on Wednesday how considerations such as this lend support to Mill's claims at the end of chapter 3.  Happy viewing!</p>
<h1>Aug 29</h1>
<p>Today we looked at an analogue to why Mill might have argued, as he did at the end of chapter 3, that conscience and society must be synthesized in any theory of morality.  Then, we looked at some classic counterexamples to Consequentialism.  For Friday, please read the following page from the BBC, as well as sections 4 and 5 from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  Again, attempt to reconstruct at least 1 argument in premise and conclusion form that you find in the reading (there are, again, many to choose from).  In regards to the BBC reading, please decide which version of consequentialism you find most compelling, and be ready to explain why.  The BBC reading can be found <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/consequentialism_1.shtml target="_blank">here</a>.  The Stanford reading can be found <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/#WhiConActVsExpCon target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!</p>
<h1>Sept 3</h1>
<p>Today there was no class since UNO was observing Labor Day!  For Wed, please read pages 32-41 (and do ALL the practice exercises) from the logic text book that we read from for the Aug 22 class.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Sept 5</h1>
<p>Today we dove back into argument extraction and did a number of practice problems.  Learning how to extract premises and conclusions from a passage of text is going to be an essential skill to learn in this class, so I wanted to use this shortened week to sharpen it up.  The examples that we went through (and many more) can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil1020/ArgumentExamples.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  As a reminder, there is no class Friday.  I will post the reading for Monday soon and will send out an email when I have done so!  Happy reading!
