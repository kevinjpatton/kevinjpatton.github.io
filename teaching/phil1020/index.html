<p>The course syllabus can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil1020/Phil1020Syllabus_v_1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Aug 22</h1>
<p>Please read sections 1.1 and 1.2 from the following logic text book.  You can download it <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Phil110_Textbook.pdf.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  I have also created a handout for these sections which you can download <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day2-Section1.1-1.2.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!</p> 
<h1>Aug 24</h1>
<p>Today we finished our breif introduction to logic by discussing valid and invalid arguments, as well cogent and non-cogent.  We also discussed some common fallacies to be aware of, and why there are harmful to reasoning.  You can download a handout on some common fallacies <a href=/teaching/phil1020/PBS_Fallacies.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  For Monday, please read the following sections from John Stewart Mill's famous work, <i>Utlitarianism</i>: 1) Happiness as an Aim (starts on page 7); 2) Chapter 3.  We will discuss the implications of this moral philosophy, and I encourage you all to work on your argument extractions for this text.  Remember to answer the following quesitons: 1) What are the author's premises?  2) What is the author's conclusion?  The link for the reading is <a href=https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/mill1863.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!</p> 
<h1>Aug 27</h1>
<p>Today we began discussing Mill's version of Consequentialism.  For Wednesday, there is NO reading (woo) but please watch <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/ap-perfect-competition-topic/ap-nash-eq-tutorial/v/prisoners-dilemma-and-nash-equilibrium target="_blank">this Khan Academy video on the prisons' dilemma</a>.  As you watch this video, ask yourself how someone who listened to their conscience ALONE in determining what to do would do.  Does this seem rational from an objective standpoint?  We will discuss on Wednesday how considerations such as this lend support to Mill's claims at the end of chapter 3.  Happy viewing!</p>
<h1>Aug 29</h1>
<p>Today we looked at an analogue to why Mill might have argued, as he did at the end of chapter 3, that conscience and society must be synthesized in any theory of morality.  Then, we looked at some classic counterexamples to Consequentialism.  For Friday, please read the following page from the BBC, as well as sections 4 and 5 from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  Again, attempt to reconstruct at least 1 argument in premise and conclusion form that you find in the reading (there are, again, many to choose from).  In regards to the BBC reading, please decide which version of consequentialism you find most compelling, and be ready to explain why.  The BBC reading can be found <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/introduction/consequentialism_1.shtml target="_blank">here</a>.  The Stanford reading can be found <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/#WhiConActVsExpCon target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!</p>
<h1>Sept 3</h1>
<p>Today there was no class since UNO was observing Labor Day!  For Wed, please read pages 32-41 (and do ALL the practice exercises) from the logic text book that we read from for the Aug 22 class.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Sept 5</h1>
<p>Today we dove back into argument extraction and did a number of practice problems.  Learning how to extract premises and conclusions from a passage of text is going to be an essential skill to learn in this class, so I wanted to use this shortened week to sharpen it up.  The examples that we went through (and many more) can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil1020/ArgumentExamples.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  For Monday, please do problems 1 - 10 from section II of the PDF we used for examples today.  Happy solving!
<h1>Sept 10</h1>
<p>Today we finished reviewing how to extract arguments from passages of texts.  The reading for the next two classes comes from W.D. Ross's classic text <i>The Right and the Good</i>.  For Wednesday's class, please read from pages 16 - 34 (end at the break on page 34).  You can download the reading <a href=/teaching/phil1020/RossRightandGood.pdf	target="_blank">here</a>.  Also, remember to do your argument extractions on what you think Ross' main claim is and what his premises are.  Happy reading!
<h1>Sept 12</h1>
<p>Today we started our discussion of W.D. Ross' <i>intuitionism</i>.  We will continue our discussion Friday, so please finish the reading from Sept 10's class.  Happy reading - and don't forget to do your argument extractions from the reading!
<h1>Sept 14</h1>
<p>Today we examined some objections to Ross' intuitionistic theory.  Many of the objections we discussed looked at aspects of a core debate between Naturalists and non-Naturalists.  In order to make sure that this distinction is clear, we will be diving a bit deeper on Monday's class.  For Monday, please read Thomas Nagel's famous paper <i>What It's Like To Be A Bat</i>.  We will discuss some non-ethical reasons to perhaps adopt non-naturalism.  You can download the paper <a href=/teaching/phil1020/Nagel_Bat.pdf	target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!
<h1>Sept 17</h1>
<p>Today we explored Nagel's reasons for being a non-naturalist / non-physicalist.  For Wednesday's class, please read the following from J.L. Mackie.  The article can downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil1020/Mackie.pdf	target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!</p>
