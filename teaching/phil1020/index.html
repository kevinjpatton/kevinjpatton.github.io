<b>Content Response:  </b>After having watched / read these items, please take a moment and consider the following question: <b>Now that you know that Google organizes search results based on what they predict you want (and will therefore most likely click on), do you trust their search results more or less?

<h1>June 4</h1>
<p>For today's class we will be looking at some material we will examine some questionable ways in which YouTube censors content.  For today's content, please watch and read the following items:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zK8LgVx2G8&t=1s" target="_blank">Video 1</a><br>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164553/youtube-coronavirus-demonetization-sensitive-subjects-advertising-guidelines-revenue" target="_blank">Reading 1</a><br>

<h1>June 5</h1>
<p>For today's class we will be looking how conspiracy theories grow and why they are spreading so rapidly today.  For today's content, please watch and read the following items:<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/pTBvKjl6wF4" target="_blank">Video 1</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88_C-fogY40" target="_blank">Video 2</a><br>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/zlvS-GrA00I" target="_blank">Video 3</a><br>
<a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/08/12/conspiracy-theories-are-dangerous-heres-how-to-crush-them" target="_blank">Reading</a><br>
<b>Content Response:  </b>After having watched / read these items, think about any conspiracy theories that you find plausible (no judgement).  After having done so, ask yourself what evidence there is for the theory; how much does the surplus or lack of evidence matter to you?  Is it worrying if your theory has almost no evidence?  Also recognize that very few of our beliefs  are held with 100% certainty; we accept that we could be wrong about a great number of things.  Conspiracy theories seem to latch on to that possibility, without requiring any positive evidence to support them.  Is that good or bad?  <b>Type up a paragraph or two on this and submit it for today's Content Response.</b></p>

<h1>June 8</h1>
<p>Today we will be looking at a conspiracy theory which combines all of last week's topics.  A few months ago, a 30 minute video was uploaded across social media outlets under the name <i>Plandemic</i>.  The video looked clean and professional and was basically an attempt to contradict the CDC and WHO's narrative about covid-19's origins and how we should respond to it.  The video has been banned on all 'normal' social media sites (YT, Twitter, Vimeo, FB, etc).  There are some quasi-sketchy ways to watch it, but I won't ask that of you.<br>

<a href="http://www.butte.edu/departments/cas/tipsheets/thinking/conspiracy.html" target="_blank">Reading</a><br>
<b>Content Response: For today's content response attempt to isolate what about the Plandemic conspiracy is unfalsifiable (as defined by the reading).  In other words, what are the claims made by Dr. Mikovits and why are they unfalsfibiable.  </b>Type up a paragraph or two on this and submit it for today's Content Response.  I will be sending an email explaining the first upcoming project as well.</p>

<h1>June 9</h1>
<p>Today we'll begin our exploration of the anti-vaccination movement.  The connection from the Plandemic-conspiracy to the Anti-Vaccination movement is not a very complicated path.  Many of the same arguments that the anti-vax community has used for years are being applied to coronavirus.  For today, please read / watch the following:<br>

<b>Content Response: Many / most / all of you were vaccinated against a variety of viruses when you were younger.  Are you thankful that you were vaccinated?  If yes, explain why.  If no, explain why.</b>  Type up a paragraph or two on this and submit it for today's Content Response.
