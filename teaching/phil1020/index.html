After having watched / read these items, please take a moment and consider the following question: <b>Now that you know that Google organizes search results based on what they predict you want (and will therefore most likely click on), do you trust their search results more or less?</b>  If more,  explain why.  If less,  explain why. Please type up an answer to this question and submit it as today's Content Response in Canvas.</p>

<h1>June 2</h1>

<a href="https://youtu.be/JSV4VZ8gdUQ" target="_blank">Video</a><br>
<a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/content/module-1-introduction-what-research" target="_blank">Reading - </a>Read through modules 1 and 2 (though you can read the entire set if you wish).  You needn't answer all of the discussion questions within each module; answer only those that I state below.<br>
For today's Content Response please answer the following questions and submit your response on Canvas:<br>
<b>Answer 1 of the 'Module 2 - Section 1 Discussion Questions', and 1 of the 'Module 2 - Section 2 Discussion Questions'.</b><br>
<b>After reflecting on today's Video, you may be worried that doing research is a hopeless task.  In an attempt to free ourselves from some of the biases Garry Gray (what a name) describes, write a short paragraph stating a few ways that you could use the internet to research some topic and how you would attempt to limit how your biases influenced that research.</b></p>
