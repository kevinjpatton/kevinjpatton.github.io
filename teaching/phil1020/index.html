<p>Today we finished our breif introduction to logic by discussing valid and invalid arguments, as well cogent and non-cogent.  We also discussed some common fallacies to be aware of, and why there are harmful to reasoning.  You can download a handout on some common fallacies <a href=/teaching/phil1020/PBS_Fallacies.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  For Monday, please read the following sections from John Stewart Mill's famous work, <i>Utlitarianism</i>: 1) Happiness as an Aim (starts on page 7); 2) Chapter 3.  We will discuss the implications of this moral philosophy, and I encourage you all to work on your argument extractions for this text.  Remember to answer the following quesitons: 1) What are the author's premises?  2) What is the author's conclusion?  The link for the reading is <a href=https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/mill1863.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy reading!</p>

<p>Today we began discussing Mill's version of Consequentialism.  For Wednesday, there is NO reading (woo) but please watch a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/ap-perfect-competition-topic/ap-nash-eq-tutorial/v/prisoners-dilemma-and-nash-equilibrium target="_blank">this Khan Academy video on the prisons' dilemma</a>.  As you watch this video, ask yourself how someone who listened to their conscience ALONE in determining what to do would do.  Does this seem rational from an objective standpoint?  We will discuss on Wednesday how considerations such as this lend support to Mill's claims at the end of chapter 3.  Happy viewing!</p>
