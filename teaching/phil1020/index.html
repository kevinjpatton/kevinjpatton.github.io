<h1>June 4</h1>
<p>For today's class we will be looking at some material we will examine some questionable ways in which YouTube censors content.  For today's content, please watch and read the following items:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zK8LgVx2G8&t=1s" target="_blank">Video 1</a><br>

<h1>June 5</h1>
<p>For today's class we will be looking how conspiracy theories grow and why they are spreading so rapidly today.  For today and tomorrow, please watch and read the following items:<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/pTBvKjl6wF4" target="_blank">Video 1</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88_C-fogY40" target="_blank">Video 2</a><br>

<a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/08/12/conspiracy-theories-are-dangerous-heres-how-to-crush-them" target="_blank">Reading</a><br>
<b>Content Response:  </b>After having watched / read these items, think about any conspiracy theories that you find plausible (no judgement).  After having done so, ask yourself what evidence there is for the theory; how much does the surplus or lack of evidence matter to you?  Is it worrying if your theory has almost no evidence?  Also recognize that very few of our beliefs  are held with 100% certainty; we accept that we could be wrong about a great number of things.  Conspiracy theories seem to latch on to that possibility, without requiring any positive evidence to support them.  Is that good or bad?  <b>Type up a paragraph or two on this and submit it for today's Content Response.</b></p>

<h1>June 8</h1>
<p>Today we will be looking at a conspiracy theory which combines all of last week's topics.  A few months ago, a 30 minute video was uploaded across social media outlets under the name <i>Plandemic</i>.  The video looked clean and professional and was basically an attempt to contradict the CDC and WHO's narrative about covid-19's origins and how we should respond to it.  The video has been banned on all 'normal' social media sites (YT, Twitter, Vimeo, FB, etc).  There are some quasi-sketchy ways to watch it, but I won't ask that of you.<br>

<a href="http://www.butte.edu/departments/cas/tipsheets/thinking/conspiracy.html" target="_blank">Reading</a><br>
<b>Content Response: For today's content response attempt to isolate what about the Plandemic conspiracy is unfalsifiable (as defined by the reading).  In other words, what are the claims made by Dr. Mikovits and why are they unfalsfibiable.  </b>Type up a paragraph or two on this and submit it for today's Content Response.  I will be sending an email explaining the first upcoming project as well.</p>

<h1>June 9</h1>
<p>Today we'll begin our exploration of the anti-vaccination movement.  The connection from the Plandemic-conspiracy to the Anti-Vaccination movement is not a very complicated path.  Many of the same arguments that the anti-vax community has used for years are being applied to coronavirus.  For today, please read / watch the following:<br>

<b>Content Response: Many / most / all of you were vaccinated against a variety of viruses when you were younger.  Are you thankful that you were vaccinated?  If yes, explain why.  If no, explain why.</b>  Type up a paragraph or two on this and submit it for today's Content Response.  Also, you can download the handout for Project 1 <a href=/teaching/phil1020/HandoutProject1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h1>June 10 and 11</h1>
<p>Today we dive into the origins of the modern anti-vaxx movement.  Since this topic is dense, I have decided to make these items count for both the 10th and the 11th.  For today, please read / watch the following:<br>
<a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/the-anti-anti-vax-vaccine/" target="_blank">Audio (caution: some cussing)</a><br>

<b>Content Response:<br>
For the June 10 content response, list some of the reasons that the Lancet had for retracting Dr. Wakefield's study and explain whether or not you agree with their reasoning.<br>
For the June 11 content response, after having listened to the America Dissected episode, how would you handle discussing the pros and cons of vaccination with someone who was anti-vax?  Would you follow Ethan Lindenberger's advice or do you have a different approach?</b></p>

<h1>June 12</h1>
<p>Since Project 1 is due by Sunday the 24th at midnight, today's content will be light. For today, please read / watch the following:<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/SImj1iRMwgM" target="_blank">Video</a><br>
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2015/09/28/how-to-protect-yourself-against-bad-science-reporting/" target="_blank">Reading</a><br>
  <b>Content Response:</b><br>
Given that few of us will ever have the knowledge and skill required to understand scientific journals, we face a challenge in preventing bad science from influencing our lives.  At this point in the class we have looked at doing good research and how bad research can lead to different kinds of bad theories.  <b>For your content response today, imagine having a friend or family member who believes that the Earth is flat.  The believe NASA is part of a global cover-up for some kind of new world order.   Type up two paragraphs explaining how you would attempt to educate them and list a 2-3 resources that you would suggest they look at.</b></p>

<h1>June 15</h1>
<p>This week we will scratch the surface of what is known as 'big data'.  Big data is the backbone of many of internet's most wonderful and horrible aspects.  Google, Spotify, TikTok, and much more rely on collecting gigabytes of data on <i>you</i>.  Additionally, big data is also shaped by the very programmers and engineers who decide the best way to organize and search all of that data.  The sheer scale of the data is both awe inspiring and horrifying.  We will look mostly at some of the ways that companies and governments misuse that data, but for today we'll just get an overview.  Please read and watch the following:<br>

  <b>Content Response:</b><br>
For today consider the following case study from Santa Clara University:<a href="https://www.scu.edu/ethics/privacy/case-study-on-online-privacy/" target="_blank"> click here</a>.  For your content response <b>answer the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th discussion questions (i.e. do not answer the 2nd or 6th questions).</b><br>

<h1>June 16</h1>
<p>Now that we understand a bit about the scope of big data, it's time to begin understanding the ways in which the private sector can employ a portion of it.  Please read and watch the following:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Lxw5rcfZg" target="_blank">Video 1</a><br>

<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17792976/facial-recognition-regulation-rules" target="_blank">Reading</a><br>
  <b>Content Response:</b><br>
After  watching today's videos, you probably have a healthy skepticism about any private company's ability to use this kind of data in a way that you are comfortable with.  The reading offered a variety of different perspectives on ways to begin regulating the 'wild west' of facial recognition.  <b>For your content response today, come up with a list of 5 ways in which the federal government could begin to regulate the ways in which private businesses can use and store images of you.  You can use suggestions from the reading.  Then, pick one of those five and elaborate on why it is important to us a society.</b><br>

<h1>June 17</h1>
<p>Today, we look at some of the ways that governments - both local and federal - use big data.  Please read and watch the following:<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/XEVlyP4_11M" target="_blank">Video 1 (warning: some cussing / adult humor)</a><br>

  <b>Content Response:</b><br>
By now, you should be aware that your digital footprints are being collected and stored by both businesses and governments.  For today consider the following case study from Santa Clara University: <a href="https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/internet-ethics/resources/chinas-social-credit-score/" target="_blank">click here</a>.  For your content response <b>choose three of the discussion questions to answer (located at the end of the reading).</b><br>

  <b>Content Response:</b><br>
For your content response <b>answer the same discussion questions from yesterday but instead of assessing them in regards to Edward Snowden, answer them in regards to Chelsea Manning and her decision to work with WikiLeaks.</b><br>

<h1>June 23</h1>
<p>This week will not have a singular focus, but will look at various aspect of how the internet is being used to make certain social problems much worse.  Please note: this is a deviation from the stated topics in the syllabus.  For today's content please read and listen to the following:<br>
<a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/scarlet-e-unmasking-americas-eviction-crisis" target="_blank">Audio - Listen to Episode 3</a><br>
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/19/880859109/zoom-call-eviction-hearings-they-ll-throw-everything-i-have-out-on-the-street" target="_blank">Reading 1</a><br>
<a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2020/4/20/21224360/covid-19-evictions-eviction-renters-landlords-coronavirus-california" target="_blank">Reading 2</a><br>
  <b>Content Response:</b><br>
Reflect upon the very difficult position that both landlord and tenant have been put in by Covid-19; man tenants could not work to make money to pay rent; landlords need rent to cover their property's mortgage payments.  If landlords evict tenants who cannot pay because of a lack of work due to Covid-19, there could be an unprecedented amount of homeless people in the very near future.  For your content response today consider the following solutions: <b>Some politicians, economists, and financial specialists recommended - back in March - that the US Federal Government ought do some sort of mortgage assistance.  This could take many forms but one option was for the federal government to provide payment on behalf of all mortgages for a 6-month period; another suggestion would mandate that any mortgage payment missed during Covid would  be tagged onto the end of the loan as another month's payment.  Do some research and summarize one policy that you think that the federal government could do to help prevent a spike in homelessness.  Include at least one source in your 1 - 2 paragraph submission.</b><br>

<h1>June 24</h1>
<p>The remainder of the week we are going to be looking at how the internet can radicalize you in ways that appear benign.  We will be doing this by listening to a few episodes of the NYT's recently finished series <i>Rabbit Hole</i>.  I would encourage you to listen to all episodes, but for our class you just need to listen to episodes 1, 2, and 3.<br>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/rabbit-hole" target="_blank">Rabbit Hole (warning: some cussing / adult topics)</a><br>
  <b>Content Response:</b><br>
For your content response please do the following items:<br>
  <b>June 24: Listen to episode 1 (Wonderland)</b>.  Caleb's story is not hard to imagine as common.  The recommendations sidebar is intended to keep you watching YouTube because they get paid a tremendous amount of money to put ads in front of users.  <b>Open up YouTube and find a video that you would normally watch (a channel you already are sub'd to, or just search for something interesting).  As the video begins (after the ad) pause it and look at the recommendations that YouTube is giving you.  Scroll through them and attempt to group them based on topic. (politics, how-to, video games, etc.)  Did any of the recommended videos seem like odd suggestions for you?  Did any look perfectly matched for you?  Did any look way off base?  Were any of the recommendations worrying?  Answer these questions for today's content response.</b><br>

<h1>June 25</h1>
<p><b>Listen to episode 2 (Looking Down).  <u>Warning: this video touches on topics involving sexual assault and verbal abuse.  If this topic is something that you wish to avoid, you can write a summary of episode 7 without needing to explain yourself)</u></b>. Video gaming culture is dominated by heterosexual cis males.  Attempts to create video games that do not present female characters in an overly sexualized manner has been met by fierce resistance in some gaming circles.  The issue was eventually framed as a battle between 'progressive / feminist gamers and game developers' vs. 'normal people who just want to play a video game'.  YouTube's algorithms now had more dots to connect as more and more people uploaded videos about the controversy.<br>
<b>1. Go to YouTube and type in 'gamergate' into the search bar and hit enter.
2. Click on whatever the top result is (you do not need to watch the actual video).<br>
3. Then, look at the recommendations area and click on the video at the top of the list.<br>
4. After the next video loads, pause and click the top item of the recommended list again.  Do this 2 more times.<br></b>
Given your history of video watching on youtube, what others similar to you have watched in regard to this topic, and that you have clicked on their recommendations 5x in a row you are now watching what YouTube predicts you will like.  Watch this 5th video.  Type up a summary both of what the video was about (include the link), and what the video's channel is about.  Include a paragraph about how successful YouTube was at predicting what you would like (e.g. was the material offensive? fun? had you known about this channel before?  did you subscribe?)<br>

<h1>June 26</h1>
<p>Listen to episode 3 (Mirror Image)</b>.  Caleb entered at one end of the rabbit hole and came out another.  YouTube itself, and the social media platforms in general, are largely the same.  If much of your day is consumed by some kind of online engagement (Twitter, the Tok, YouTube, etc.) then much of your day is being influenced by very sophisticated AI.  Their jobs are to put content in front of you that will keep you using that app longer.  Every person suggested to follow on Twitter is done so because you will (according to the AI) have a higher likelihood of engaging with that person's content.  Every TikTok video is put before your eyes because their algorithms know that people like you (similar age / race / gender / etc.) watch those videos more than others.  On and on it goes.  <b>For today, reflect on the fact that the social media platforms that you prefer are all, in some way, manipulating you in order to keep you using their product.  Does that matter to you?  Does it make you more or less likely to keep using their product?  Do you think that you should be able to opt-out of their recommendations?  Answer these questions in as many paragraphs as you require.</b></p>
