<p>  Today we finished our breif introduction to logic by discussing valid and invalid arguments, as well cogent and non-cogent.  We also discussed some common fallacies to be aware of, and why there are harmful to reasoning.  You can download a handout on some common fallacies <a href=/teaching/phil1020/PBS_Fallacies.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  For Monday, please read the following sections from John Stewart Mill's famous work, <i>Utlitarianism</i>: 1) Happiness as an Aim (starts on page 7); 2) Chapter 3.  We will discuss the implications of this moral philosophy, and I encourage you all to work on your argument extractions for this text.  Remember to answer the following quesitons: 1) What are the author's premises?  2) What is the author's conclusion?
