  <h1>Homework</h1>
  <p><b>Oct 6</b><br>
For today's class we began familiarizing ourselves with full truth tables (handouts linked above).  For Thursday, please read sections 6.1 and 6.2 from our textbook (linked above) and do parts A, B, C, and D from pages 216 and 217.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Oct 8</b><br>
For today's class we finished familiarizing ourselves with full truth tables.  For Tuesday, please read section 6.3, and do parts B, D, F, and H at the end of 6.3.  Next weekend will be the first problem set (take home exam) so making sure that you feel *very* comfortable doing this homework will be essential to getting a good grade.  If you do not feel comfortable, then please look back over the previous homework assignments.  If those problems are too difficult, then contact me ASAP.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Oct 13</b><br>
For today's class we began utilizing partial / indirect truth tables in order to reduce the number of lines that were needed to solve various problems.  The handout for this portion is already linked above.  For homework, please do Part B on page 228 and Part G on page 229.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Oct 15</b><br>
For today's class we went over most of Tuesday's homework.  For the weekend, you will be taking your first problem set which can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/PS1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Keep in mind that there is to be zero communication with other students (past and present) about the problem set.  You are free to email me to discuss any issues that you are having.  You will also submit your problem set via email to me (I just remembered that there have been issues with some students not being able to see the assignments that I post on Canvas so email will be easier).  There is no class Tuesday because of fall break so I'll see ya Thursday.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Oct 22</b><br>
For today's class we went over the first 8 inference rules that we'll be using with our new proof method.  For the weekend, please do problems 1 - 10 from section 3 on page 398, and problems 1-10 from section 3 on page 408.  The handouts for the inference rules are both linked above.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Oct 29</b><br>
For homework today please do problems 11 - 25 from section 3 on pages 408 and 409 from the Hurley textbook.  On Tuesday we will (after reviewing the homework) begin looking at 5 new rules, tho we will not start using them until Thursday.  At this stage in the class some of you may feel very lost.  The best advice I can offer is to go back and re-read the sections of the textbooks which explain how the rules work.  Then, attempt to do the proofs shown alongside the rules but do not look at the book's full proof.  Instead, attempt it on your own and consult the book only when you cannot figure out the next line.  Then, go back to our homework and the answers that I have given and attempt those without looking unless you are stuck.  Practice makes perfect so if you do not practice, the rules will not make sense.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Nov 5</b><br>
For today's class we introduced the first five of our replacement rules (they are explained in the third hand out above).  For today's homework, please do problems 6 - 29 from page 420.  Happy solving!
