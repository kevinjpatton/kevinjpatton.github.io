For today's class we began looking at expressively adequate connectives besides the 5 that we have been using so far.  In fact, we proved that we do not even need the set of 5 that we have been using - certain subsets are sufficient.  I'm still making today's handout as I've never taught this topic in a class like this before, so I'll email it tonight / tomorrow.  For Wednesday please read section 6.5 from our textbook, and do all parts of questions 1 and 2 from section J.  Happy solving!
<p><b>October 31</b><br>
For today's class we finished looking at expressively adequate connectives by discussing disjunctive normal form.  The handout for this topic can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/ExComDNF.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please be aware that I am open to your input on this handout as I have not taught this topic before.  If it is incomplete, then <i>please</i> let me know.  For homework, please do parts C and D from 7.2, and part A from 7.3.  For reading, please read through 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3.  A separate handout for the rules will be available on Monday.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 4</b><br>
For today's class we decided to go ahead and look at the rules from both 7.4 and 7.5.  Given this, we now have 13 out of our 18 rules for use in proofs.  The handout for the rules will be available on Wednesday, so you will need to consult your notes and/or the textbook for any questions about how the rules work.  For Wednesday, please  do Part A from 7.4, and Part A from 7.5.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 6</b><br>
For today's class we went over Monday's homework, and introduced our final 5 rules.  The handouts that I am including do not follow the order of our textbook as I had created them using a different textbook.  I have not updated them as I like the practice problems that the older textbook uses.  Also, please consult your notes for the rules which go by different names.  You can download the Handout 1 <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Inference Rules 1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, Handout 2 <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Inference Rules 2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, Handout 3 <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Replacement Rules 1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and Handout 4 <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Replacement Rules 2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  A handout containing just the 18 rules can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/18 Rules.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  For Monday, please do problems 1-8 from section 7.6.  Next week's homework will come from a different textbook, and will be substantially more challenging.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 11</b><br>
For today's class we went over the assigned homework.  In order to gain comfort with our 18 rules, we will be doing a lot of proofs this week.  There are no new readings or handouts, but for homework we are using the following PDF (download <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/18RulesPractice.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).  Please do problems 1 - 15 from section I, and problems 1 - 10 from section III.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 13</b><br>
For today's class we went over the assigned homework.  For homework please do problems 16 - 30 from the same PDF that November 11's homework was assigned from.  For Monday please read section 7.7 from our textbook.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 18</b><br>
For today's class we went over the assigned homework, and began discussing conditional proof.  For homework please do the remaining problems from the previous handout (31 - 45).  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 20</b><br>
For today's class we went over the assigned homework, and began to solve proofs with the conditional proof method that we discussed Monday.  Please remember that there is <b><i>NO CLASS MONDAY 11/25 NOR 11/27!</b></i>  There is no homework over the weekend, though there is a handout on conditional proof (which can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/ConditionalProof.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).  I will be sending an answer key out for the previous round of homework as that will be what most closely mimics next week's problem set.  The problem set will be available for download on Nov 25 and will be due Dec 2 before class begins.  I will also send an email via canvas on Monday with the problem set attached.  Have a nice break and, as always, happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 25</b><br>
The problem set can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Problems Set 2_Final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please read the directions carefully, and do not hesitate to email me if you have any questions.  If you email closer to Thanksgiving, though, it is more likely that I will take longer to reply.  Enjoy your break and HAPPY solving!</p> 
<p><b>December 2</b><br>
For today's class you turned in your second problem set, and we did a bunch of problems involving conditional proof.  The handout for conditional proof was already posted on Nov 20.  The homework for Wednesday can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/ConditionalProofProblems.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please do problems 10 - 20 for Wednesday but <b> you do not need to attempt to do the problems without conditional proof</b>.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>December 4</b><br>
For today's class we went over the conditional proof homework, and introduced the method known as indirect proof / proof by contradiction.  That handout for this method can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Indirect Proof.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  The homework for this section can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/IndirectProofProblems.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and please do 1 - 15 for Monday.  Happy solving!</p>
