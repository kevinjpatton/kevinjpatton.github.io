For today's class we finished our introduction to the Boolean / Modern square of opposition, and its allowable inferences.  The answer key for your homework from last week can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/HWAnswers1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  It can be useful to redo this assignment a number of times if your grade was less than you desired.  For Wednesday please read section 3.4.  For homework do parts A and B from 3.4 <b><i>BUT</b></i> use the Boolean / Modern square of opposition to assess the arguments only.  Do not use  the Aristotelian / Traditional square yet since we haven't learned it!  Simply assess whether the conclusion validly follows the premise.  The handout for today's class can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Day 6 - Section 3.2 and 3.4.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy solving!</p>

I am pushing the problem set back until next Wednesday.

Test the validity of the arguments as we did in class.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>September 30</b><br>
