It can be useful to redo this assignment a number of times if your grade was less than you desired.  For Wednesday please read section 3.4.  For homework do parts A and B from 3.4 <b><i>BUT</b></i> use the Boolean / Modern square of opposition to assess the arguments only.  Do not use  the Aristotelian / Traditional square yet since we haven't learned it!  Simply assess whether the conclusion validly follows the premise.  The handout for today's class can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Day 6 - Section 3.2 and 3.4.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>October 28</b><br>
For today's class we began looking at expressively adequate connectives besides the 5 that we have been using so far.  In fact, we proved that we do not even need the set of 5 that we have been using - certain subsets are sufficient.  I'm still making today's handout as I've never taught this topic in a class like this before, so I'll email it tonight / tomorrow.  For Wednesday please read section 6.5 from our textbook, and do all parts of questions 1 and 2 from section J.  Happy solving!
<p><b>October 31</b><br>
For today's class we finished looking at expressively adequate connectives by discussing disjunctive normal form.  The handout for this topic can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/ExComDNF.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Please be aware that I am open to your input on this handout as I have not taught this topic before.  If it is incomplete, then <i>please</i> let me know.

For today's class we decided to go ahead and look at the rules from both 7.4 and 7.5.  Given this, we now have 13 out of our 18 rules for use in proofs.  The handout for the rules will be available on Wednesday, so you will need to consult your notes and/or the textbook for any questions about how the rules work.  For Wednesday, please  do Part A from 7.4, and Part A from 7.5.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 6</b><br>
For today's class we went over Monday's homework, and introduced our final 5 rules.  The handouts that I am including do not follow the order of our textbook as I had created them using a different textbook.  I have not updated them as I like the practice problems that the older textbook uses.  Also, please consult your notes for the rules which go by different names.  You can download the Handout 1 <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Inference Rules 1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, Handout 2 <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Inference Rules 2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, Handout 3 <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Replacement Rules 1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and Handout 4 <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/Replacement Rules 2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  A handout containing just the 18 rules can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/18 Rules.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  For Monday, please do problems 1-8 from section 7.6.  Next week's homework will come from a different textbook, and will be substantially more challenging.  Happy solving!</p>
<p><b>November 11</b><br>
For today's class we went over the assigned homework.  In order to gain comfort with our 18 rules, we will be doing a lot of proofs this week.  There are no new readings or handouts, but for homework we are using the following PDF (download <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/18RulesPractice.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).  Please do problems 1 - 15 from section I, and problems 1 - 10 from section III.  Happy solving!</p>
