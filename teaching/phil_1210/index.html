  <h1>Homework</h1>
  <p><b>Oct 6</b><br>
For today's class we began familiarizing ourselves with full truth tables (handouts linked above).  For Thursday, please read sections 6.1 and 6.2 from our textbook (linked above) and do parts A, B, C, and D from pages 216 and 217.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Oct 8</b><br>
For today's class we finished familiarizing ourselves with full truth tables.  For Tuesday, please read section 6.3, and do parts B, D, F, and H at the end of 6.3.  Next weekend will be the first problem set (take home exam) so making sure that you feel *very* comfortable doing this homework will be essential to getting a good grade.  If you do not feel comfortable, then please look back over the previous homework assignments.  If those problems are too difficult, then contact me ASAP.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Oct 13</b><br>
For today's class we began utilizing partial / indirect truth tables in order to reduce the number of lines that were needed to solve various problems.  The handout for this portion is already linked above.  For homework, please do Part B on page 228 and Part G on page 229.  Happy solving!</p>

<p><b>Oct 15</b><br>
For today's class we went over most of Tuesday's homework.  For the weekend, you will be taking your first problem set which can be downloaded <a href="/teaching/phil_1210/PS1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  Keep in mind that there is to be zero communication with other students (past and present) about the problem set.  You are free to email me to discuss any issues that you are having.  You will also submit your problem set via email to me (I just remembered that there have been issues with some students not being able to see the assignments that I post on Canvas so email will be easier).  There is no class Tuesday because of fall break so I'll see ya Thursday.  Happy solving!</p>
