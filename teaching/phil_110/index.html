<h2>
It was called to my attention that I misspoke about how the Boolean/Modern and Aristotelian/Traditional systems handle the issue of existential import in regards to particular propositions.  The Aristotelian standpoint differs from the Boolean standpoint only with regard to universal (A and E) propositions. The two standpoints are identical with regard to particular (I and O) propositions. Both the Aristotelian and the Boolean standpoints recognize that particular propositions make a positive assertion about existence (i.e. that something does exist). For example, from both standpoints, the statement “Some cats are animals” asserts that at least one cat exists that is an animal. Also, from both standpoints, “Some fish are not mammals” asserts that at least one fish exists that is not a mammal. Thus, from both standpoints, the word “some” implies existence.  Sorry!
