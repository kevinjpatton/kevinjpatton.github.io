<h1>Day 8</h1>
<p>Today we finished the content we will be covering for categorical logic.  You can download today's handout <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day10-Section5.2.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  For reading, please read pages 112 - 123.  Since I am not getting this info to you very rapidly, homework will not be too burdensome; please do the practice problems on page 123, part A.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 9</h1>
<p>Today we began our two day review of categorical logic.  There was no new handout for today's class.  For reading, review any previously assigned sections that you are having trouble with.  For homework, please do the practice problems on page page 101, part C and D, and page 123, part B.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 10</h1>
<p>The problem set is now available for download.  You can download it <a href=/teaching/phil_110/PS-1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  It is due Monday, July 24th, at 1030am.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 11</h1>
<p>Today we started our dive into Sentential Logic.  You can download today's handout <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day13-Section6.1-6.3_1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  For reading, please read pages 188 - 201 (stop before section 5.4), and do the practice problems on page 206, parts B and C.  Happy solving!
 <h1>Day 12</h1>
<p>Today we explored in much more depth what a truth-table can show you about any particular wff.  You can download today's handout <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day14-Section6.3_2-6.5.pdf target="_blank">here</a> - though it does cover MORE material than we got to today.  For reading, please read pages 213 - 216, and do the practice problems on page 216 - 217, parts A, B, and E.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 13</h1>
<p>Today we explored even more properties of truth-tables, and how they can be used to evaluate arguments.  I do not have a good excuse for not putting up your handout and listing the homework for tonight, I just plumb forgot.  Today's handout, however, is just the second half of yesterday's handout.  You can begin working on the following problems, but they will not be collected - though that should not stop you from attempting them!  For reading, please read pages 218 - 221, and do the practice problems on pages 221 - 222 parts A and C.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 14</h1>
<p>Today we reviewed homework and assessed arguments for validity by using truth-tables.  There is no new handout for today, as these last 3 days are all aspects of the same topic.  For reading, please read pages 223 - 226, and do the practice problems on page 229, part G.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 15</h1>
<p>Today we reviewed for the first exam - which is tomorrow (Aug 2)!  If you are worried, then go back over each assigned homework series, and re-read the assigned sections.  You can also email me if you are confused on a particular problem.  Best of luck and happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 16</h1>
<p>Today you took the first exam.  I will have it graded within a few days!</p>
<h1>Day 17</h1>
<p>Today we began looking at about the indirect truth-table method as well as a small sampling of our inference rules.  Struggling and working through homework problems will be essential to mastering this portion of the class, so please continue to dig into the homework.  Today's handout was based off of a logic textbook that organized this material in a slightly different order, but is still useful; you can download it <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day17-Section6.5-7.1.pdf
 target="_blank">here</a>.  For reading, please read section 7.4 (pages 223 - 226), and do the practice problems on page 229, part G; then read section 7.3 (pages 240 - 245), and do the practice problems on page 245, part A.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 18</h1>
<p>Today we continued looking at our rules of inference.  Today's handout is still based off of the previous logic textbook that yesterday's was, so the rules are a bit out of order - though the practice exercises are extremely useful.  You can download it <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day18-Section7.2.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  For reading, please read section 7.4 (pages 245 - 247), and for practice problems, please do problems 2, 3, 9. 20, 21, and 23 from <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Summer2017_eightrulespractice.pdf target="_blank">this PDF</a>.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 19</h1>
<p>Today we discussed the first 5 exchange rules explained from section 7.5.  There is no homework to do, as you have a problem set to work on this weekend.  I have two handouts for the exchange rules which can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day19-Section7.3.pdf target="_blank">here</a> and <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day20-Section7.4.pdf target="_blank">here</a> The problem set is due Monday, August 7 at 10:30am, and can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil_110/PS-2_Summer.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  Happy solving!</p>
