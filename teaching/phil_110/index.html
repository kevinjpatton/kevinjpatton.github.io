<h1>Day 5 - January 24</h1>
<p>Today we began discussing categorical logic by going through section 4.1.  Today's handout can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day4-Section4.1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  The assigned homework is as follows: Page 203: #2, #3, #5, #6, #8.  Zach will also have the homework you turned in today graded and returned to you by, at the latest, next Tuesday.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 6 - January 26</h1>
<p>Today we continued our discussion of categorical logic by covering section 4.2 and part of section 4.3.  Today's handout can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day6-Section4.2-4.3_1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was called to my attention that I misspoke about how the Boolean/Modern and Aristotelian/Traditional systems handle the issue of existential import in regards to particular propositions.  The Aristotelian standpoint differs from the Boolean standpoint only with regard to universal (A and E) propositions. The two standpoints are identical with regard to particular (I and O) propositions. Both the Aristotelian and the Boolean standpoints recognize that particular propositions make a positive assertion about existence (i.e. that something does exist). For example, from both standpoints, the statement “Some cats are animals” asserts that at least one cat exists that is an animal. Also, from both standpoints, “Some fish are not mammals” asserts that at least one fish exists that is not a mammal. Thus, from both standpoints, the word “some” implies existence.  Sorry!</p>
<p>The assigned homework is as follows: Page 208: section 1: #3, #5, #8 (ignore the questions of distribution); section 2: #2, #3; section 3:#2, #3; section 4: #2, #3.  Happy solving!</p>

<p>Today we reviewed for Exam 1.  Please see the link above for the review guide.  Also, if you are uncomfortable with proofs as we have done them thus far, the starred problems in each exercise section have their answers posted in the back of the book.  Try to work through those problems and then compare your answer with the one in the back of the book.  If you get stuck, feel free to email Zach or myself, or see us during office hours.  Best of luck!

<h1>Day 15 - March 2</h1>
<p>Today we spent the class covering as many homework problems as was possible.  Exams were also passed back so if you missed class today, you can ask Zach in discussion sections for yours tomorrow.  The assigned homework is as follows: Page 355, section II: #2, #3, #6, #8; Page 365: #2, #3, #17; Page 366, section II: #2, #8; Page 367, section III: #9.  Happy solving!</p>
<h1>Day 16 - March 7</h1>
<p>Today we finalized our discussion of chapter 6, as well as used truth tables to prove that certain logical relationships hold between certain premises and certain conclusions.  This allowed us to prepare for chapter 7's material.  Additionally, there are some decent YouTube videos which also explain truth tables in ways which may be helpful.  Please note: some of the symbols used in these videos are different than ours but make no substantive difference.  The arrow symbol, →, is the same as our horseshoe, ⊃.  The bar symbol, ¬, is the same as our tilde, ~.  The caret symbol, ∧, is the same as our dot, ·.  The double arrow, ↔,is the same as our triple bar, ≡.  Those videos can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfessorSerna/search?query=truth+table" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRMC-ttjhwM" target="_blank">here</a>.  The assigned homework is as follows: Page 355, section II: #11, #12, #14, #15; Page 365: #18; Page 366, section II: #12, #14, #15.  Happy solving!
<h1>Day 17 - March 9</h1>
<p>Today we went over some of the more complicated problems from the homework.  Given some of the issues that some student's are having with the indirect truth tables, I have attempted to explain this in a different way in today's handout which can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day17-Section6.5-7.1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  Also, today's homework will be a split between more indirect truth table problems and stuff from 7.1.  Today's assigned homework is as follows: Page 366, section II: #8, #9, #15 (I know some of these have been assigned previously - consider it a freebee!); Page 367: #2, #3; Page 396-397, section I: #6, #12, #14, #18, #20.  Happy solving - and remember, I need to collect homework soon!
<h1>Day 18 - March 14</h1>

Happy solving and have a safe spring break!
<h1>Day 20 - March 28</h1>
<p>Today we went over the final rules of exchange from section 7.4.  You can download today's very brief handout <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day20-Section7.4.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.  The assigned homework is ONLY: Page 433: #32.  Homework hint: Given our new rule Tautology, if you can get (~C v ~C), then you could use Tautology to derive ~C and you would be done.  (My proof was 11 lines - can you do it more efficiently!?)
 <h1>Day 21 - March 30</h1>
<p>Today we worked through Tuesday's homework (which was collected) and went ahead and did more problems from section 7.4.
