<h1>Day 6 - January 26</h1>
<p>Today we continued our discussion of categorical logic by covering section 4.2 and part of section 4.3.  Today's handout can be downloaded <a href=/teaching/phil_110/Day6-Section4.2-4.3_1.pdf target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It was called to my attention that I misspoke about how the Boolean/Modern and Aristotelian/Traditional systems handle the issue of existential import in regards to particular propositions.  The Aristotelian standpoint differs from the Boolean standpoint only with regard to universal (A and E) propositions. The two standpoints are identical with regard to particular (I and O) propositions. Both the Aristotelian and the Boolean standpoints recognize that particular propositions make a positive assertion about existence (i.e. that something does exist). For example, from both standpoints, the statement “Some cats are animals” asserts that at least one cat exists that is an animal. Also, from both standpoints, “Some fish are not mammals” asserts that at least one fish exists that is not a mammal. Thus, from both standpoints, the word “some” implies existence.  Sorry!</p>
<p>The assigned homework is as follows: Page 208: section 1: #3, #5, #8 (ignore the questions of distribution); section 2: #2, #3; section 3:#2, #3; section 4: #2, #3.  Happy solving!</p>

<h1>Day 11 - February 16</h1>
<p>Today we reviewed for Exam 1.  Please see the link above for the review guide.  Also, if you are uncomfortable with proofs as we have done them thus far, the starred problems in each exercise section have their answers posted in the back of the book.  Try to work through those problems and then compare your answer with the one in the back of the book.  If you get stuck, feel free to email Zach or myself, or see us during office hours.  Best of luck!
