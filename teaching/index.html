<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>As a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>  I have, however, moved back to Omaha for the time being, and am very thankful to be teaching at my alma mater which is the University of Nebraska - Omaha.  For the Spring 2019 semester, I will be teaching four classes.  Three of these classes will be a modified introduction to ethics class involving a survey of contemporary ethical theories, as well as contemporary ethical issues which are assessed using those aforementioned theories.  The fourth class that I will be teaching is an upper-level Metaethics class.  You can find the syllabus and the daily assignments under the Currently Teaching heading.</p>
