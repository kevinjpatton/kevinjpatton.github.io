<h2>Current Classes</h2>
<p>I regularly teach the following courses at the <b><a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/philosophy/about-us/directory/kevin-patton.php" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Omaha</a></b>. If you are a student of mine then select one of the following links for the relevant course material. Additionally, you can view syllabi for previous classes that I've taught, and I have created some documents related to my thoughts on teaching.</p>

  <li><a href="/teaching/phil_1010/index.html" target="_blank">PHIL1010 - Meaning of Life</a></li>
  <ul>
  <li>We all find ourselves at one point or another wondering what everything adds up to. This sentiment manifests itself as different questions: 'why are we here?', 'what's my purpose?', 'how can I lead a fulfilling life?', or, perhaps most relevantly, 'what is the meaning of life?'. Now that you're in college, these questions are of the essence. Where will you go from here? Which skills should you develop? Which major should you choose? What should you pursue? Love? Family? Friendship? Education? Career? Fame? Fortune? Religious devotion? Service to others? Fulfillment? Happiness? What does it mean to be happy or fulfilled? In this course, we're going to set all else aside and dedicate real effort to coming to grips with these questions. Our focus will be on developing our ability to think about what we're asking and acquiring the tools necessary to assess the responses on offer.</li>

<h2>Teaching Theory</h2>
<p>My approach to teaching revolves around trying to find the right balance between the intuitive and the technical. Below you can find how I am currently attempting to implement that balance.</p>
