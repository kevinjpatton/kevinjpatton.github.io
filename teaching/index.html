title: Teaching - Kevin Patton

<p>My passion for teaching began during high school when I taught martial arts. This initial experience sparked a lifelong love for sharing knowledge and fostering growth in others. While pursuing my undergraduate studies in philosophy, I had the privilege of serving as an unofficial teaching assistant, further solidifying my commitment to education. During graduate school, I gained valuable experience as a teaching assistant for various professors and classes. It was during this time that I taught my first independent course on Big Data ethics, a transformative experience that allowed me to design the curriculum and create teaching materials. Since then, I have been fortunate to teach a wide range of courses, from introductory surveys to specialized courses developed from scratch. Additionally, I've the opportunity to teach at a variety of academic institutions including both the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, and Omaha, and Kansas State University. The opportunity to connect with diverse students, ignite intellectual curiosity, and witness their academic progress continues to be a driving force in my career. Below, you'll see a list of course that I  currently / regularly teach. To see a list of previously / not-regularly taught classes, click <a href="/teaching/pastcourses/"><b>here</b></a>.</p>

                <p>This course is a detailed examination of selected topics in normative ethics and/or metaethics. Normative ethical questions to consider may include: Is the morally right thing to do always the thing that has the best consequences, as so-called "consequentialists" believe? What sorts of things are intrinsically good, i.e., good in themselves, regardless of their effects? Metaethical questions to be considered may include: Are there any objective moral facts? If so, where do they come from?</p>
