<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>As a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>  we are offered many oppotunities to either teach our own class, or to be a teaching assistant for a class.  I have, however, moved away from Lincoln as I am working exclusively on my dissertation.  I am very thankful to be currently teaching at my alma mater, which is the University of Nebraska - Omaha.
