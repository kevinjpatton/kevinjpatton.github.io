<h2>Welcome to Ethical Theory!</h2>
<p>Use the menu at the top to navigate to our syllabus, class readings, course assignments, and much more.<br><br>This course is a detailed examination of selected topics in normative ethics and/or metaethics. Normative ethical questions to consider may include: Is the morally right thing to do always the thing that has the best consequences, as so-called "consequentialists" believe? What sorts of things are intrinsically good, i.e., good in themselves, regardless of their effects? Metaethical questions to be considered may include: Are there any objective moral facts? If so, where do they come from?</p>
