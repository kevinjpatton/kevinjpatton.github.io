<h2>Welcome to Ethical Theory!</h2>
<p>This course explores the fascinating (and often perplexing) foundations of morality. We'll tackle theories that challenge the very existence of moral truths, like Error Theory and Emotivism, and grapple with their implications. We'll explore the nature of "goodness" itself, dissecting arguments from renowned thinkers like G.E. Moore. Our journey will take us through the intricate world of value theory, examining the distinctions between intrinsic, extrinsic, and instrumental value. Finally, we'll confront the enigmatic concept of "moral luck," as articulated by Bernard Williams and Thomas Nagel, and wrestle with its potential solutions. Prepare to question your assumptions and dive deep into the philosophical underpinnings of right and wrong.<br><br>Use the menu at the top to navigate to our syllabus, class readings, course assignments, and much more.</p>
