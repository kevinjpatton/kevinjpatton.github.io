<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome, students and philosophers alike! My time as a graduate student at the  <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a> is coming to a close as I will be defending my dissertation this summer (2024). The dissertation explores the orthodox approach to the value of knowledge and its associated problems. This orthodox approach is ultimately rejected, and a novel series of answers are offered to those long-standing problems. Additionally I'm very fortunate to be a visiting professor at my alma mater, the <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/philosophy/about-us/directory/kevin-patton.php" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Omaha</a>. If you're a current student of mine, you can access the course resources under the <b><a href="/teaching/index.html" >Teaching</a></b> tab. Once my dissertation is successfully defended, it will be accessible via ProQuest, and uploaded here under the <b><a href="/teaching/index.html">Research</a></b> tab tab. If you wish to contact me, then please use the <b><a href="/teaching/index.html">Contact</a></b> tab tab above.</p>
