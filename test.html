This sentiment manifests itself as different questions: 'why are we here?', 'what's my purpose?', 'how can I lead a fulfilling life?', or, perhaps most relevantly, 'what is the meaning of life?'. Now that you're in college, these questions are of the essence. Where will you go from here? Which skills should you develop? Which major should you choose? What should you pursue? Love? Family? Friendship? Education? Career? Fame? Fortune? Religious devotion? Service to others? Fulfillment? Happiness? What does it mean to be happy or fulfilled? In this course, we're going to set all else aside and dedicate real effort to coming to grips with these questions. Our focus will be on developing our ability to think about what we're asking and acquiring the tools necessary to assess the responses on offer.</p>

<p class="thumbnail-text"><img src="/teaching/Under_Construction.jpg" alt="Thumbnail" class="thumbnail">Welcome, students and philosophers alike! My time as a graduate student at the  <a href="http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/graduate-students#patton" target="_blank">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a> is coming to a close as I will be defending my dissertation this summer (2024). The dissertation explores the orthodox approach to the value of knowledge and its associated problems. This orthodox approach is ultimately rejected, and a novel series of answers are offered to those long-standing problems. Additionally I'm very fortunate to be a visiting professor at my alma mater, the <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-arts-and-sciences/philosophy/about-us/directory/kevin-patton.php" target="_blank">University of Nebraska - Omaha</a>. If you're a current student of mine, you can access the course resources under the <b><a href="/teaching/index.html" >Teaching</a></b> tab. Once my dissertation is successfully defended, it will be accessible via ProQuest, and uploaded here under the <b><a href="/teaching/index.html">Research</a></b> tab tab. If you wish to contact me, then please use the <b><a href="/teaching/index.html">Contact</a></b> tab tab above.</p>
