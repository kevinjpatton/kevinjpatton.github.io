This sentiment manifests itself as different questions: 'why am I here?', 'what's my purpose?', 'how can I lead a fulfilling life?', or, perhaps most relevantly, 'what is the meaning of life?'. Such questions are usually pondered for a brief moment, after which we realize the sheer enormity of what we're asking and just how impossible finding an answer seems to be, and so we return to the demands of daily life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now that you're in college, these questions are of the essence. Where will you go from here? Which skills should you develop? Which major should you choose? What should you pursue? Money? Fulfillment? Happiness? What does it mean to be happy or fulfilled? In this course, we're going to set all else aside and dedicate real effort to coming to grips with these questions. Our focus will be on developing our ability to think about what we're asking and acquiring the tools necessary to assess the responses on offer and evaluate their viability. To be clear, the questions we'll be asking certainly have answers, though we have yet to figure out precisely what they are. Our task will be to engage in the search for the truth. By the end, you will have a greater understanding of what it is you want to know about your existence and how best to pursue that which is most meaningful.
