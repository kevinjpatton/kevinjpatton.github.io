            <h2>PHIL1010 - Meaning of Life</h2>
            <p>We all find ourselves at one point or another wondering what everything adds up to. This sentiment manifests itself as different questions: 'why am I here?', 'what's my purpose?', 'how can I lead a fulfilling life?', or, perhaps most relevantly, 'what is the meaning of life?'. Such questions are usually pondered for a brief moment, after which we realize the sheer enormity of what we're asking and just how impossible finding an answer seems to be, and so we return to the demands of daily life. Now that you're in college, these questions are of the essence. Where will you go from here? Which skills should you develop? Which major should you choose? What should you pursue? Money? Fulfillment? Happiness? What does it mean to be happy or fulfilled? In this course, we're going to set all else aside and dedicate real effort to coming to grips with these questions. Our focus will be on developing our ability to think about what we're asking and acquiring the tools necessary to assess the responses on offer and evaluate their viability. To be clear, the questions we'll be asking certainly have answers, though we have yet to figure out precisely what they are. Our task will be to engage in the search for the truth. By the end, you will have a greater understanding of what it is you want to know about your existence and how best to pursue that which is most meaningful.</p>

                <h2>PHIL2030 - Introduction to Ethics</h2>
                <p>This course delves into the core concepts and controversies that have shaped moral philosophy, from the allure of relativism and egoism to the enduring ideals of happiness, obligation, and justice. We'll grapple with the complexities of freedom, conscience, love, religious precepts, and the very language we use to express our moral values. Through critical analysis and lively discussion, you'll develop the tools to navigate the ethical dilemmas of our time and forge your own moral compass.</p>

                <h2>PHIL3230 - Philosophy of Video Games</h2>
                <p>This course examines the philosophy of video games, focusing on their status as a unique and evolving art form. Students will explore how games challenge traditional definitions of art, narrative, and beauty. They'll delve into the ethical complexities of violence and morality within games and consider the broader impact of video games on players and society. Through readings, discussions, and hands-on gameplay, students will analyze the complex philosophical and artistic dimensions of this powerful cultural force.</p>

                <h2>PHIL3050 - Ethical Theory</h2>
                <p>This course is a detailed examination of selected topics in normative ethics and/or metaethics. Normative ethical questions to consider may include: Is the morally right thing to do always the thing that has the best consequences, as so-called "consequentialists" believe? What sorts of things are intrinsically good, i.e., good in themselves, regardless of their effects? Metaethical questions to be considered may include: Are there any objective moral facts? If so, where do they come from?</p>

        <p>PHIL3960 Kant: Ethics and Values, Spring 2024</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Taught an independent study on Kant’s ethical and axiological commitments. This independent study required meeting with the student twice a week to discuss assigned readings, and to review any written work. Ultimately, this resulted in the student authoring three papers. The first two were shorter and narrowly focused responses to specific issues at play for a Kantian. The second of these two papers was developed into a longer paper which sought to argue that Christine Korsgaard’s Kantian ethics could, with certain modifications, overcome a specific objection. This paper is intended to also serve as the foundation for a writing seminar paper (a course required for the philosophy major) for the student.</p>

<p>Supervised an honors contract for a student which focused on a detailed reading of G.E. Moore’s <em>Principia Ethica</em> in order to assess Moore’s intuitionism. This culminated in weekly reading summaries for relevant chapters and sections of the <em>Principia</em>, and ultimately into a research paper where the student concluded that Moore’s intuitionism was internally inconsistent. This paper is intended to also serve as the foundation for a writing seminar paper (a course required for the philosophy major) for the student.</p>

This culminated in an in class student-led lecture that described the current state of research on the issue, and possible avenues of future research. This project tied in with the student's larger research project in preparation for medical school applications.</p>

<p>Title: The Value of Knowledge and its Problems</p>
<p>Committee: David Henderson (committee chair)</p>
<p>William Melanson (reader)</p>
<p>Aaron Bronfman (reader)</p>
<p>Edward Becker (reader)</p>
<p>This dissertation answers the three value problems in epistemology. These three problems require an answer as to how knowledge is more valuable 1) than mere true belief, 2) any of the proper subsets of knowledge, and 3) in kind than that which falls short of knowledge. The methodology used to provide an answer to these problems relies on the arguments put forth in a rarely discussed paper from Ward Jones. In short, the Jonesian approach can be summed up as the view that epistemic axiology and analysis ought to be kept separate. The Jonesian framework instead looks outside of the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge to find properties of knowledge which, though contingent, can explain the distinctive value of knowledge. This framework, though remarkably robust, requires going against what I consider to be the orthodox approach to the problems. This orthodox approach relies on two axiological assumptions. The first is that every component of an analysis on knowledge must provide independent value to knowledge. The second assumption is that the value of knowledge cannot be derived from factors excluded from an analysis of knowledge. Once these assumptions are appropriately discarded, the Jonesian view has a straightforward answer to the first problem. Answering the second requires assessing Jonathan Kvanvig’s claim that a satisfied Gettier condition contributes no independent value. While I agree with Kvanvig regarding a satisfied Gettier condition, I will argue that an unsatisfied Gettier condition is not likewise neutral; it contributes disvalue. With that distinction in place, a solution to the second problem follows immediately. The third value problem, however, is a different kind of problem altogether. Answering it requires not only the Jonesian framework, but also a novel account of how we determine final value. Once this account is offered, a Jonesian answer to the tertiary problem follows immediately. This dissertation closes by applying the Jonesian framework to an argument that claims there can be no modal conditions on knowledge due to such conditions failing to help answer the value problems. This claim will be found wanting.</p>
