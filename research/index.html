<h1>Research</h1>
<p>I'm fascinated by philosophical questions which revolve around knowledge, language, logic, science, the mind, reality, and religion. My current research delves into the intersection of epistemology and axiology, but I regularly teach on issues related to axiology, metaethics, and formal logic. I have also been known to <i>occasionally</i> venture into the murky world of metaphysics (though stays there are often like Alice going to Wonderland). To view previous syllabi for those classes, please click the Teaching tab. As I (hopefully) publish in these various areas, I will post those pieces below.</p>
