<h1>Research</h1>
<p>I'm fascinated by philosophical questions which revolve around knowledge, language, logic, science, the mind, reality, and religion. My current research delves into the intersection of epistemology and axiology, but I have taught courses on value theory, metaethics, formal logic, and medical ethics. I have also been known to - <i>on occasion</i> - venture into the murky world of metaphysics...though stays there are often like Alice going to Wonderland. To view previous syllabi for my classes, please click the <b><a href="/teaching">Teaching</a></b> tab. As I (hopefully) publish in some of these areas, I will post those pieces here.</p>
