<h1>Research</h1>
<p>I'm fascinated by philosophical questions which revolve around knowledge, language, logic, science, the mind, reality, and religion. My current research delves into the intersection of epistemology and axiology, but I have also taught courses on value theory and metaethics, formal logic, and medical ethics. Additionally, I have been known to <i>on occasion</i> venture into the murky world of metaphysics (though stays there are often like Alice going to Wonderland). To view previous syllabi for my classes, please click the Teaching tab. As I (hopefully) publish in some of these various areas, I will also post those pieces below.</p>

<p>Dissertation to be posted summer of 2024!</p>
