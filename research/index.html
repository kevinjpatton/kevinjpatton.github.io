<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>I'm fascinated by philosophical questions which revolve around knowledge, language, logic, science, the mind, reality, and religion. My current research delves into the intersection of epistemology and axiology, but I have taught courses on value theory, metaethics, formal logic, and medical ethics. I have also been known to venture - <i>on occasion</i> - into the murky world of metaphysics...though stays there are often like Alice going to Wonderland.
