<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>I am deeply interested in the exploration of fundamental philosophical questions, particularly those concerning knowledge, language, logic, science, the mind, reality, and religion. My current research focuses on the intriguing intersection of epistemology, axiology, and the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular interest in the epistemological and ethical challenges posed by this rapidly developing technology. My teaching experience spans a diverse range of courses, including value theory, ethics / metaethics, formal logic, medical ethics, and aesthetics (with a special emphasis on the philosophical dimensions of video games). I occasionally venture into the enigmatic realm of metaphysics, though, much like Alice's adventures in Wonderland, my sojourns there tend to be fleeting.
