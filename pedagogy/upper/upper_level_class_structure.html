    <strong>Class Structure and Pedagogical Approach for Upper-Level/Advanced Courses</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">Welcome to a rigorous and intellectually stimulating environment designed to cultivate advanced critical thinking, analytical writing, and scholarly discourse. Our class sessions will follow a structured format that emphasizes depth of understanding and engagement with complex philosophical arguments:</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">
    <strong>1. Formal Argument Presentation and Discussion (20 minutes):</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<ul class="standard-list">
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">Before class, you will be asked to reconstruct the main argument of the assigned reading in formal, premise-conclusion form.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">At the beginning of class, a few students will be randomly selected to present their reconstructed arguments on the board.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">We will then engage in a detailed discussion of the presented arguments, analyzing their structure, validity, soundness, and implications.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">This collaborative analysis will deepen our understanding of the author's reasoning and highlight potential areas of disagreement or further exploration.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">
    <strong>2. Guided Lecture and Discussion (40 minutes):</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<ul class="standard-list">
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">Building upon the initial discussion, I will lead a lecture that delves deeper into the author's argument, examining its nuances, implications, and potential weaknesses.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">You are encouraged to actively participate by questioning assumptions, offering alternative interpretations, and engaging in respectful debate.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">The goal is to foster a scholarly community where we collectively grapple with challenging ideas and refine our understanding of complex philosophical issues.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">
    <strong>3. Objections, Clarifications, and Final Thoughts (15 minutes):</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<ul class="standard-list">
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">This segment is dedicated to addressing any remaining questions, clarifying points of confusion, and exploring potential counterarguments to the author's position.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">I encourage you to think critically about the material and to share your own well-reasoned objections or alternative perspectives.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">This is an opportunity to refine your analytical skills, practice articulating complex ideas, and engage in meaningful intellectual exchange with your peers.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">

    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">
      <strong>Analytical Writing:</strong>
    </span>
