<h2>Introductory / General Education Classes</h2>
<p><b>Structure:</b> My introductory / general education philosophy courses aim to provide a broad foundation and foster a love of critical inquiry. Classes typically begin with readings from secondary sources which masterfully introduce a key philosophical theory. Subsequent sessions delve deeper into a challenging area of the theory, often focusing on a very specific issue (e.g. Kant versus Korsgaard on lying). Generative AI tools are integrated to create complex scenarios, challenging students to apply these theories in a practical context.<br><b>Assessment:</b> Assessments in introductory classes are designed to support students' development. Exams initially mirror the kind of standard assessment style of American public high-school (i.e. multiple choice and short answer prompts). Over the course of the semester they evolve into assessments much more complex (i.e. the applications of theories to difficult cases, exposition of the views of various authors, and attempts at original argument). Annotated notes ensure consistent engagement and offer a way for students to demonstrate their understanding. The final assessment incorporates even more complex AI-generated ethical scenarios, exposition, and original argument.</p>

<h2>Specialized / Upper-level Classes</h2>
<p><b>Structure:</b> In specialized / upper-level courses, depth replaces breadth as the primary focus. The specific topic and direction of exploration vary based on the course and student interests. Across all such classes I encourage students to take the lead in driving discussions and formulating their own philosophical positions. Classes usually center around in-depth readings and seminar-style conversations.<br><b>Assessment:</b> To promote deeper engagement and develop writing skills, students in specialized courses submit annotated notes of the readings, as well as abstracts for the readings which they author themselves. Traditional papers, though required, are often supplemented with alternative assessments emphasizing critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and philosophical analysis. The students are also required to create a certain amount of visuals (such as flow charts, diagrams, or even comic strips (in the style of <a href="https://existentialcomics.com" target="_blank">Existential Comics</a>) for the readings throughout the semester.</p>
