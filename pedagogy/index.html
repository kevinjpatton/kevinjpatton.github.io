<h2>How I Approach Teaching</h2>
<p>My teaching philosophy balances intuitive understanding with technical rigor, making philosophical concepts both accessible and challenging. I stay updated on the latest research to ensure my teaching methods are effective and transparent, creating a supportive learning environment.</p>

<p>Recognizing that many students are not adequately prepared for the demands of philosophical study, I use pedagogical research to bridge this gap. Scaffolding readings and assignments helps students build their skills progressively, enabling those who struggle initially to achieve success by the end of the semester. This structured approach fosters confidence and competence in philosophical thinking and writing.</p>
