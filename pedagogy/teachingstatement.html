<h2>Teaching Statement</h2>
<p>My teaching philosophy centers on fostering both a deep conceptual understanding of philosophical ideas and the ability to communicate these ideas effectively. I believe that appreciating the beauty and complexity of philosophical inquiry requires balancing intuitive understanding with technical rigor. By presenting material in an accessible yet challenging manner, I encourage students to develop their own critical thinking and analytical skills. I prioritize staying current with the latest research on effective pedagogical strategies, continuously refining my teaching methods to provide students with a high-quality education.<br><br>

<b>Introductory Courses: Building a Strong Foundation</b><br><br>

In introductory courses, I create a structured and supportive environment that emphasizes active participation, conceptual understanding, and the development of fundamental writing skills. Each class session is designed to engage students actively with the material. For the first meeting of the week, students submit a thesis statement summarizing the assigned reading, and three students are selected to present their theses on the board for discussion. For the second meeting of the week, students submit annotated notes of another reading, promoting active reading and note-taking skills while minimizing plagiarism.<br><br>

Lectures seamlessly integrate thesis discussions, exploring core intuitions and connecting them to broader themes within the readings. Detailed handouts and supplementary readings offer additional support for student comprehension. Assessments combine in-class and take-home components. Students write thesis statements and abstracts for selected readings, with increasing complexity throughout the semester, fostering the development of clear and concise writing. In-class exams leverage AI-generated scenarios, allowing students to apply theoretical frameworks to novel situations and demonstrate their understanding in a handwritten format. A unique museum assignment, around the 10-week mark, encourages students to apply philosophical concepts to real-world artistic expressions, enriching their understanding and fostering connections between disciplines.<br><br>

<b>Upper-Level Courses: Deepening Analysis and Scholarly Discourse</b>

Upper-level courses build on the foundational skills developed in introductory courses, emphasizing in-depth analysis, scholarly discourse, and analytical writing. Classes begin with students reconstructing the reading's argument in standard form, followed by a collaborative discussion of three student-presented arguments. This reinforces students' understanding and ability to engage in rigorous philosophical dialogue. Lectures maintain a structured format while allowing for relevant tangential discussions, as students in upper-level courses typically possess a broader philosophical background. I encourage connections between previously learned concepts and current material, fostering a deeper understanding of the subject matter.<br><br>

Assessments include regular submissions of section summaries, abstracts, and annotated notes to enhance analytical writing skills and reduce plagiarism. The visual representation assignment encourages creative expression and deeper engagement with philosophical arguments. The final exam requires handwritten essay responses to chosen prompts, assessing students' comprehension and analytical skills. The option to submit a visual representation for one prompt promotes diverse communication and offers an alternative way to demonstrate understanding.<br><br>

<b>Common Threads: Structure and Adaptability</b><br><br>

Despite the differing learning goals, both introductory and upper-level courses share a common structure. Both emphasize active engagement, feature structured lectures with room for discussion, and culminate in comprehensive assessments that evaluate writing and conceptual understanding. This adaptability allows me to tailor my teaching to the specific needs of each course and student population while maintaining a cohesive pedagogical approach. By fostering a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment, I empower students to achieve their full potential, regardless of their prior experience or academic background.</p>
