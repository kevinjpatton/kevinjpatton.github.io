    <strong>Introductory Course Exam Structure</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">This exam has two components, each worth 50 points. The out-of-class portion, assigned a week prior to the in-class exam, involves writing thesis statements and abstracts for three chosen readings from the course. The thesis statements should clearly state the main argument, while the abstracts should concisely summarize the reading's thesis, arguments, and significance. The in-class portion requires analyzing AI-generated scenarios using theories from class, answering in short answer or essay format.

    <strong>Format:</strong>
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">The exam consists of two parts:</span>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">
      <strong>In-Class Component (50 points):</strong>
    </span>
  </li>
  <ul class="standard-list">
    <li>
      <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">On the day of the exam, you will be presented with AI-generated scenarios that require analysis based on the theories covered in class. There will be five scenarios available, of which you will select three. You will adopt the stated theory and assess the scenario according to that theory.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">You will be expected to identify relevant concepts, apply them to the specific context, and provide well-reasoned arguments that a proponent of the stated theory would accept. We will have a review day where we use AI to generate scenarios similar to the ones you will see on the day of the exam and, as a class, do the relevant assessment.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">If you require testing center accommodations, you must first get approval from them. Once approved, they will provide me with the documentation and you will take the exam there.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

      <strong>Abstract:</strong>
    </span>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">
      In this chapter, I will argue that happiness, defined as pleasure and the absence of pain, is the sole intrinsic good and the ultimate aim of human action. I will observe that the desire for happiness is a universal human trait, and this widespread desire serves as evidence for its desirability. I will contend that all other seemingly desirable things, such as virtue or knowledge, are ultimately sought because of their association with pleasure or their ability to prevent pain.</span>
