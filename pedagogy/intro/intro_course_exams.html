      <strong>Thesis Statement:</strong>
    </span>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">
      In this paper, I will argue that the&nbsp; innate desire for pleasure and aversion to pain, as evidenced by human behavior and introspection, provides a firm foundation for the principle of utility. This principle, which claims that actions are right when the best proportion of happiness to pain is produced, is the cornerstone of the moral theory known as Utilitarianism.</span>

      <strong>Abstract:</strong>
    </span>
    <span style="color:#1f1f1f;">
      This study delves into the psychological and empirical underpinnings of the principle of utility, the cornerstone of my utilitarian philosophy. By examining the innate human desire for pleasure and aversion to pain, I will demonstrate how these fundamental motivations serve as the basis for a moral framework that prioritizes the maximization of happiness for the greatest number of individuals. Through a combination of introspection, observation, and analysis of human behavior, I will have proved that happiness is the only good. This conclusion will not only bolster the theoretical foundations of utilitarianism but also provide practical insights into how individuals and societies can strive towards greater happiness and well-being.</span>
