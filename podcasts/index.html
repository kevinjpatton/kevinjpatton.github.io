<h1>Podcasts</h1>
<p>I have been fascinated with AI's potential to enhance learning since ChatGPT hit the scene just a few years ago. To that end I have worked on developing supplementary material for some of my courses which utilizes Google's powerful NotebookLM software. This software allows, among many other things, to create audio summaries of uploaded material. These summaries take the form of two AI-voiced hosts discussing different aspects of the material. While not infallible, these pods do have the benefit of being yet another way for students to think about and assess our course readings independent from my own lectures. So far, I have implemented these podcasts for my Ethical Theory course, and my Meaning of Life course. Check them out below!</p>
